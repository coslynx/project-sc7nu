# tags-py-discord

## Project Overview
The project aims to create a tags.py module in discord.py utilizing asyncpg db for managing tags within a Discord server.

## Features
- Commands:
  - add-tag: Allows users to add custom tags to the server.
  - remove-tag: Enables users to remove tags they have created.
  - mytag: Displays all tags created by the user.
  - show-all-tags: Shows all tags available in the server.
  - tag-open: Opens a specific tag to view its content.
  - admin-remove-tag: Allows admins to remove any tag in the server.
  - admin-suspend-tag: Suspends a user from using add-tag and remove-tag commands.
  - admin-unsuspend-tag: Unsuspends a user from using add-tag and remove-tag commands.

## Enhancements
- Implement tag categories for better organization.
- Add a search functionality to find specific tags quickly.
- Introduce tag voting system for user-rated tags.
- Include tag cooldowns to prevent spamming of tag commands.
- Implement tag permissions based on user roles for added security.
- Create a tag history feature to track changes made to tags.
- Integrate tag notifications for users when a new tag is added or removed.

## Programming Languages
Python will be used for developing the tags.py module in discord.py due to its compatibility with asyncpg and discord.py libraries.

## APIs
- Discord.py API will be utilized to interact with the Discord server and manage tags efficiently.
- asyncpg API will be integrated to interact with the PostgreSQL database asynchronously for storing and retrieving tag data.

## Packages and Libraries
- discord.py (latest version) will be used to create the Discord bot and handle interactions with the Discord server.
- asyncpg (latest version) will be employed for asynchronous interactions with the PostgreSQL database for efficient tag management.
- psycopg2 (latest version) will be utilized to establish a connection between Python and the PostgreSQL database.
- datetime (built-in) for handling timestamps and date-related functionalities.

## Rationale for Technical Choices
- Python is chosen for its readability, ease of use, and extensive library support, making it ideal for developing the tags.py module.
- Discord.py API is essential for seamless integration with the Discord server, enabling the bot to respond to commands and manage tags effectively.
- asyncpg API is selected for its asynchronous capabilities, ensuring efficient database interactions without blocking the Discord bot's functionality.
- psycopg2 is necessary for establishing a connection to the PostgreSQL database and executing SQL queries for tag management.
- The datetime library is built-in and provides necessary functionalities for managing timestamps and dates related to tag creation and modification.

By incorporating these programming languages, APIs, packages, and libraries, the tags.py module in discord.py will be equipped with the necessary tools to implement the desired features and enhancements effectively, providing a robust and efficient solution for managing tags within a Discord server.
